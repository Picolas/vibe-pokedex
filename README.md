# Pokemon - Pokedex Next.js

Complete Pokedex application built with Next.js, using the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to display and compare Pokémon information.

## About

This application is a **test application** that was **entirely AI-generated** (AI-coded). No line of code was written manually - all source code was automatically produced by an AI assistant.

## Features

- **Pokémon Search** : Search by name or ID with real-time suggestions
- **Detail Display** : Complete card with statistics, types, abilities
- **Comparison** : Side-by-side comparison of two Pokémons with radar charts
- **Infinite Catalog** : Paginated browsing with lazy loading on scroll
- **Modern Interface** : Clean design with Shadcn UI and Motion animations

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js 16** (App Router)
- **TypeScript** (strict mode, no `any`)
- **React Query** (TanStack Query) for data management
- **Jotai** for global state (comparison)
- **Zod** for validation
- **Shadcn UI** for components
- **Motion** for animations
- **Recharts** for radar charts
- **TanStack React Form** for forms

## Getting Started

Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Development Principles

- **Clean Code** : Clean and maintainable code
- **SOLID** : Adherence to SOLID principles
- **TypeScript strict** : No `any`, explicit types everywhere
- **Server Components** : Default usage, Client Components only when necessary
- **Performance** : Optimizations with React Query, lazy loading, memoization

## API

This application uses the public [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to fetch Pokémon data.

## Important Note

⚠️ **This application is a test/demonstration project entirely generated by AI. It is not intended for production use.**
